# Classifying-AI-vs-Human-Art

The art industry has long been a realm of creativity, expression, and innovation. However, in recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has begun to make its mark on this domain, transforming artistic practices and giving rise to novel forms of expression. As AI-generated art takes the art world by storm, it not only captivates audiences but also raises complex ethical questions that demand thorough examination and responsible solutions. In this project, we unveil an innovative AI model designed to classify art as human-made or AI-generated with a remarkable accuracy of 90%, addressing these ethical challenges head-on while staying true to our responsibilities as ethical engineers.
